      <h1>Organ & Tissues Donation</h1>
      <h3>1. What is an organ ?</h3>
      <p>
        Organ Donation is donating a donor's organs like heart, liver, kidneys,
        intestines, lungs, and pancreas, after the donor dies, for the purpose
        of transplanting them into another person who is in need of an organ.
      </p>

      <h3>2.What are the different types of Organ Donation?</h3>
      <p>
        Living Donor Organ Donation: A person during his life can donate one
        kidney (the other kidney is capable of maintaining the body functions
        adequately for the donor), a portion of pancreas (half of the pancreas
        is adequate for sustaining pancreatic functions) and a part of the liver
        (the segments of liver will regenerate after a period of time in both
        recipient and donor). Deceased Donor Organ Donation: A person can donate
        multiple organ and tissues after (brain-stem/cardiac) death. His/her
        organcontinues to live in another personӳ body.
      </p>

      <h3>3.Is there any age limit for Organ Donation?</h3>
      <p>
        Age limit for Organ Donation varies, depending upon whether it is living
        donation or cadaver donation; for example in living donation, person
        should be above 18 year of age, and for most of the organs deciding
        factor is the person's physical condition and not the age. Specialist
        healthcare professionals decide which organs are suitable case to case.
        Organs and tissue from people in their 70s and 80s have been
        transplanted successfully all over the world. In the case of tissues and
        eyes, age usually does not matter. A deceased donor can generally donate
        the Organs & Tissues with the age limit of:

        <br />Kidneys, liver : up-to 70 years<br />
        Heart, lungs : up-to 50 years<br />
        Pancreas, Intestine : up-to 60-65 years<br />
        Corneas, skin : up-to 100 years <br />Heart valves : up-to 50 years
        <br />Bone : up-to 70 years
      </p>
      <h3>4.Who can be a Donor?</h3>
      <p>
        Living Donor: Any person not less than 18 years of age, who voluntarily
        authorizes the removal of any of his organ and/or tissue, during his or
        her lifetime, as per prevalent medical practices for therapeutic
        purposes.<br />
        Deceased Donor: Anyone, regardless of age, race or gender can become an
        organ and tissue donor after his or her Death (Brainstem/Cardiac).
        Consent of near relative or a person in lawful possession of the dead
        body is required. If the deceased donor is under the age of 18 years,
        then the consent required from one of the parent or any near relative
        authorized by the parents is essential. Medical suitability for donation
        is determined at the time of death.
      </p>
      <h3>5.Do I need to carry my donor card always?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, it will be helpful for the health professionals and your family.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6.Are donors screened to identify if they have a transmissible disease?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, Blood is taken from all potential donors and tested to rule out
        transmissible diseases and viruses such as HIV and hepatitis. The family
        of the potential donor is made aware that this procedure is required.
      </p>
      <h3>7.Can I be a donor if I have an existing medical condition?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, in most circumstances you can be a donor. Having a medical
        condition does not necessarily prevent a person from becoming an organ
        or tissue donor. The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue
        are suitable for transplant is made by a healthcare professional, taking
        into account your medical history.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8.Can I be an organ donor, if I have been rejected to donate blood?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are
        suitable for transplant is always made by a specialist, taking into
        account your medical history. There may be specific reasons why it has
        not been possible to donate blood, such as having anemia or had a blood
        transfusion or had hepatitis in the past or there may be reasons why you
        could not donate blood because of your health at the time - sometimes a
        simple thing like a cold or medication that you are taking can prevent
        you from donating blood.
      </p>
      <h3>
        9.Can a dead body be left for medical education or research after the
        organs have been retrieved for donation?
      </h3>
      <p>
        No, Bodies are not accepted for teaching purposes if organs have been
        donated or if there has been a post-mortem examination. However, if only
        the corneas are to be donated, a body can be left for research.
      </p>
      <h1>Organs & Tissues Transplant</h1>
      <h3>1.Heart Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        The heart is the hardest working muscle in our bodies, pumping blood
        throughout the body. And just like any muscle, it can be subject to
        fatigue, especially if it has been weakened by a number of
        cardiovascular diseases.
      </p>
      <h3>2.Kidney Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        The kidneys function as our body’s filters, cleaning blood of waste and
        impurities. They also release hormones that regulate blood pressure,
        control production of red blood cells, and promote growth of healthy
        bones.
      </p>
      <h3>3.Liver Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        The liver is the largest organ in the body. It is a complex organ
        responsible for hundreds of crucial functions such as the breakdown of
        harmful substances in our blood and the production of bile that aids in
        digestion.
      </p>
      <h3>4.Lung Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        A healthy person breaths at least 12 to 14 times per minute removing
        carbon dioxide from the blood and exchanging it with oxygen. While a
        person can live a normal life with only 30 percent of lung function.
        Lung transplants are recommended for those with severe lung disease,
        such as cystic fibrosis, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
        and emphysema.
      </p>
      <h3>5.Pancreas Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine.
        It produces juices or enzymes that help break down food and hormones
        that help control blood sugar levels. Problems with the pancreas can
        lead to many health problems. These include pancreatitis, or
        inflammation of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer and cystic fibrosis, a
        genetic disorder in which thick, sticky mucus can also block tubes in
        your pancreas.
      </p>
      <h3>6.Intestine Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        Small intestine transplants are rare and most often transplanted in
        combination with the liver, stomach and pancreas in small children. The
        intestines – both the small and large – run 25 feet long throughout our
        bodies, digesting food and helping the body to absorb the necessary
        nutrients while also getting rid of the waste products. The small
        intestine handles much of the nutrient absorption, while the large
        intestines reabsorb water from digested foods and send it back into the
        blood stream. Image of Intestine The most common reason leading to
        transplant is short bowel syndrome caused by conditions like tumors,
        Crohn’s disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases, or congenital
        defects.
      </p>
      <h3>7.Tissue Donation and Transplants</h3>
      <p>
        Hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. benefit from life-enhancing
        tissue transplants each year. While the donation of organs is primarily
        limited to patients who die as a result of brain death, virtually anyone
        who dies as a result of cardiopulmonary death — the heart stops beating
        — can be considered a tissue donor.
      </p>
      <h3>8.Corneas</h3>
      <p>
        The cornea is the clear layer on the front of the eye. A corneal
        transplant is surgery to replace the cornea with tissue from a donor. It
        is one of the most common transplants done with a very high success
        rate. Corneal transplantation is recommended for people who have.
      </p>
      <h3>9.Bone/tendons</h3>
      <p>
        Bones and tendons can be used to replace or reconstruct tissue destroyed
        by tumors, trauma or infection, saving limbs that would otherwise be
        amputated. Hundreds of thousands of patients benefit from transplants
        using donated bone for surgeries ranging from dental surgery, knee
        reconstruction and back surgery. Bone, tendon and related tissues are
        processed by bone banks and made available to surgeons on an as needed
        basis.
      </p>
      <h3>10.Heart Valves</h3>
      <p>
        Donated heart valves can replace damaged ones, allowing the heart to
        function again. When used in young patients, these donated heart valves
        can actually “grow” with the recipient and reduce the need for repeated
        surgeries. Human heart valves have advantages over mechanical valves
        because of lower risk of infection and no need for blood thinning drugs
        required with mechanical valves.
      </p>
      <h3>11.Blood Vessels/ Veins</h3>
      <p>
        Donated blood vessels or veins can be used in patients who require
        coronary artery bypass surgery, a routine procedure that saves thousands
        of lives and allows these individuals to return to their normal
        lifestyles. For individuals suffering from diabetes or other diseases
        that cause a decrease in the blood flow, surgeons may use donated veins
        to repair damaged vessels and restore blood flow — in many cases saving
        a recipient’s leg from amputation. The saphenous vein, a long vein on
        the inside of the leg, is the primary vein recovered from donors for
        transplant.
      </p>
      <h3>12.Skin</h3>
      <p>
        Donated skin is needed for patients suffering from burns or trauma, and
        used as a temporary covering to protect the body from infection and
        promote healing. Donated skin is also used for cleft palate repair or
        mastectomy reconstruction. Skin is typically removed from a donor in
        tissue-thin layers from the back and thigh area.
      </p>

      <h1>Deceased Donor Related Transplant</h1>
      <h3>1. What is Cadaver/Deceased?</h3>
      <p>
        The Oxford Dictionary defines 'Cadaver' as 'a dead human body'.
        Medically a 'Cadaver' is a corpse used for dissection and study. In the
        area of Organ Transplantation, 'cadaver' refers to a brain-dead body
        with a beating heart, on life support system.
      </p>
      <h3>2.What Organs and Tissues can a Deceased donor donate?</h3>
      <p>
        If different organs and tissues are in medically fit conditions,
        following organs and tissues can be donated:<br />
        <strong>Organs</strong><br />
        Two kidneys, Liver, Heart, Two lungs, Intestine, Pancreas,<br />
        <strong>Tissues</strong><br />
        Two corneas, Skin, Heart valves, Cartilage / Ligaments, Bones /Tendons,
        Vessels.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>3.What is Brain-stem Death?</h3>
      <p>
        Brain stem death is cessation of function of the brain stem due to
        irreversible damage. It is an irreversible condition and the person has
        died. It is also called Brain Death in India. A brain stem dead person
        cannot breathe on his own; however the heart has an inbuilt mechanism
        for pumping as long as it has a supply of oxygen and blood. A ventilator
        continues to blow air into lungs of brain stem dead persons, their heart
        continues to receive oxygenated blood and medicine may be given to
        maintain their blood pressure. The heart will continue to beat for a
        period of time after brain stem death - this does not mean that the
        person is alive, or that there is any chance of recovery. The
        declaration of brain stem death is made with accepted medical standards.
        The parameters emphasize the 3 clinical findings necessary to confirm
        irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including
        the brain stem: coma (loss of consciousness) with a known cause, absence
        of brainstem reflexes, and apnea (absence of spontaneous breathing).
        These tests are carried out twice at the interval of at-least 6-12 hours
        by the team of Medical Experts. Brain-stem Death is accepted under the
        Transplant Human Organ Act since 1994.
      </p>
      <h3>4.Is Brain-stem Death legally accepted as death?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, As per the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 Brain Stem
        Death is legally accepted as death.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Who will certify the Brain-stem Death?</h3>
      <p>
        ACT AND RULES UNDER TRANSPLANTATION OF HUMAN ORGANS ACT (THOA)<br />
        As per THOA Board of Medical Experts Consist of following will certify
        Brain-stem Death:<br />

        1. Doctor in charge of the hospital (medical superintendent)<br />
        2. Doctor nominated from a panel of Doctors appointed by the Appropriate
        Authority<br />
        3. Neurologist/neurosurgeon/intensivist nominated from a panel appointed
        by the Appropriate Authority.<br />
        4. Doctor treating the patient.<br />
        The panel of four doctors carries out the tests together to certify
        brain death.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>6.Who explains to the family about the brain-stem death?</h3>
      <p>
        The doctor (Intensivist/ neurologist/neurosurgeon) who is treating the
        patient will explain to the family about brain-stem death.
      </p>
      <h3>
        7.If the family is willing to donate organs of the potential donor, how
        can they proceed for more information in terms of brain-stem dead?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The family can approach the counselor of the hospital, the transplant
        coordinator or the doctors and nursing staff of the ICU.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8.What are the reasons for time delays in deceased organ donation?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Confirmatory tests for brain death have to be done twice within an
        interval of six hours between the tests. Once consent for organ donation
        has been obtained, coordinating the process of organ retrieval takes
        time. Organ retrieval from deceased donors involves many hospitals , and
        transplant teams should ensure that the donated organs match as
        perfectly as possible with the recipient. If it is a medico-legal case,
        a post-mortem has to be performed and this involves both the police as
        well as the Forensic Medicine department.
      </p>
      <h3>
        9.How quickly should the donated Organs by a deceased donor, be
        transplanted?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Healthy organs should be transplanted as soon as possible. Different
        organs can be transplanted within different time frame as mentioned
        below:<br />
        Heart: 4-6 Hours<br />
        Lungs: 4-8 Hours<br />
        Intestine: 6-10 Hours<br />
        Liver: 12-15 Hours<br />
        Pancreas: 12-24 Hours<br />
        Kidneys: 24-48 Hours<br />
      </p>
      <h3>10.Who will receive my organ?</h3>
      <p>
        Your vital organs will be transplanted into those individuals who need
        them most urgently. Gifts of life (Organs) are matched to recipients on
        the basis of medical suitability, urgency of transplant, duration on the
        waiting list and geographical location. our team will work round the
        clock, every day of the year and cover the whole of the city. Tissue is
        very occasionally matched, e.g. for size and tissue type, but otherwise
        is freely available to any patient in need of a transplant.
      </p>
      <h3>
        11.Who can give consent for organ donation after brain-stem death?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A person legally in possession of the deceased person can sign the
        consent form. This is usually done by a parent, spouse, son/daughter or
        brother/sister. By signing a consent form the family says that they do
        not have any objection to the removal of organs from the body of their
        loved one. It is a legal document. This form is kept with the hospital.
